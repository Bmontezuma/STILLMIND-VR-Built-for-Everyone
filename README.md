# 🌿 StillMind VR

**StillMind VR** is a free, donation-supported VR sanctuary designed to provide *instant relief* for people experiencing overwhelming emotional distress — including panic attacks, PTSD episodes, anxiety, grief, and self-harm thoughts.

Built in Unity 6, this project is grounded in one mission:

> 💚 *No one in crisis should be met with a paywall. No one should feel alone when they’re at their lowest. Everyone deserves a place to feel safe, to breathe, and to heal.*

## 🧠 What Is StillMind?

StillMind VR is a deeply personal, non-commercial mental health experience. It’s not a game. It’s not just an app. It’s a lifeline.

Whether you're a veteran struggling with PTSD, a teen overwhelmed by bullying, or someone quietly suffering in their room — **StillMind** is designed to say:

> “You’re safe now. Let’s breathe.”

## ❤️ Why It Exists

> “I don’t want to make money from people who are in pain.  
> I want to help them. That’s it.”  
> — *Brandon Montezuma, Creator of StillMind*

StillMind is for the people who don't have the words, the ones who feel like they're out of time, the ones who've been told to just "calm down" when they’re falling apart.

This project is being developed with input from mental health professionals to ensure it’s not just beautiful, but **effective**, compassionate, and trauma-aware.
